# PanoramAI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tmcclintock/PanoramAI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tmcclintock/PanoramAI)

Panoramic images using generative networks, and (in the future) panoramic images conditional on smaller field-of-view images.

## Installation

Install the requirements and then this repository

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Much of the training data for this project was generated using the synthetic panoramic image tool called the [LandscapeGenerator](https://github.com/tmcclintock/LandscapeGenerator), which is not currently `pip` installable.

## Usage

This section is still being finalized.
